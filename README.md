# BlackFridayHackaton

This exercise was proposed as a [hackaton by Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/black-friday/), a community of data science enthusiasts.

The idea was to predict Purchase Amount from a dataset containing some user usage information, like Product ID and Product Categories, and demograpic information, like Gender, Age Range and Time Living in the City.  I did work on the assignment as requested by the hackaton, but my main aim here was to explore the **tuning process** and try to derive some first conclusions from it. I was particularly interested into checking how many iterations the model needed to run to reach a stable conclusion of which parameter value was the best - which could potentially save time in modeling -, and to check the degree to which such a value was indeed impactful in the model performance, comparing to other values close to it.

I considered this to be an important first attempt, from my part, to better understand the dynamics of tuning.
